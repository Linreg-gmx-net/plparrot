# PL/Parrot 2.0

This is where the new PL/Parrot codebase lives. Currently we are migrating to the new Parrot Embed API
as well as making the necessary changes for PostgreSQL 9.x.

## Contributing

Since the master branch currently does not even compile, all work is being done in the master branch. When things stabilize a bit, I will switch to feature branches.

If you fork this repo, please submit pull requests from a feature branch. Thanks!

## Requirements

Originally PL/Parrot targetted PG 8.4 or higher, but our new requirements will be PG 9 or higher.
